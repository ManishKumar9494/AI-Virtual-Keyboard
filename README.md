# AI-Virtual-Keyboard
This project implements a Virtual Keyboard using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe that allows users to type without a physical keyboard. Instead of pressing physical keys, users can control the keyboard using hand gestures captured through a webcam.  The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
